Ptolemy
=======

A Simple Astronomy Educational App.

This is an incomplete personal project where I'm attempting to recreate several astronomical algorithms in JavaScript accurately through heavy use of the fantastic Bignumber.js library (https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/).

Development is underway with traditional BDD with Jasminie (https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine).

TODO
=======

* Finish views for lunar phases.  
* Implement detection of different mooons.
* Build GPS UI logic
